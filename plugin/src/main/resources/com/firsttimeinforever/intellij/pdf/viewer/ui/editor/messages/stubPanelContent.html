<h2>JCEF is not available!</h2>
<p>
  Seems like your current runtime does not provide JCEF classes.<br>
  If you are sure that it does - please ensure <strong>'ide.browser.jcef.enabled'</strong> registry property is set to
  true.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Why am I seeing this?</h3>
<p>
  This plugin uses new IntelliJ platform implementation of web browser called JCEF (Java Chromium Embedded Framework).
  This feature is still in development, so there might be some bugs.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Please ensure you are:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Running IDE with JetBrains Runtime</li>
  <li>You are using default JBR bundled with IDE</li>
  <li>JCEF is enabled (check ide.browser.jcef.enabled registry flag - it should be enabled)</li>
</ul>
